# TODO

# Questions
# who determines whether they need storage? depends on whether we have a final address
# need acknowledgement from employee

# is it employee determines if they need storage? 
# is it depenpds on situation? when the shipment arrives and whether employee has a short term rental?

# what kind of notification do we get when employee is done with survey? (send through gullie)
# what kind of notification do we get when employee is done with paperworks? (send through gullie)


# is it possible to ask multiple vendors for quotes? if yes, at what step it comes in? 
# is the same survey being used by all vendors? 

# for now: just one vendor

# move date is different with service date? move date is Jan 5th but shipment pick up happens at Jan 3rd? 

=============


# setups evals
# a mock mock-xxx-company.gullie.agent email
# a mock vendor email account
# a mock employee email account

# tests cases
# fake emails
# fake personal info

# milestone 1
# milestone 2
# milsetone 3
# milestone 4


# tests/evals

# layers in tests
# state transitions -> unit tests

email in -> 3 state transitions happening(1->2->3) -> email out

units tests(implementation): 
testing 1->2 
2-3

left most spectrum: dump everything into LLM, give all tools, no orchestration on inividual agent level
# shipping: 
# orchestratin within shipping agent to facilitate the workflow
# max flexibility


right most spectrum: having everything hardcoded, if, else logic
